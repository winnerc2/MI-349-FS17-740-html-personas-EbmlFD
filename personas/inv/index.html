        <h3> General Information </h3>
        <p> Age: 61 </p>
        <p> Occupation: Retired Ceo </p>
        <p> Location: United States </p>
        <p> Traits: Business Savvy, space interest </p>

        <h3> Goal </h3>
        <p>
          To determine whether investing in commercial space travel by investing in
          Space Express will be lucrative in the long run.  Brent will want to learn
          long term plans as well as how this particular company plans to distance itself
          from competitors.
        </p>

        <h3> Attitude </h3>
        <p>
          Sees themselves as a VIP to the new business.  As such Brent expects to
          receive a first class trip, and mainly sees the trip as a trial to evaluate
          the potential for growth in the future.
        </p>

        <h3> Behavior </h3>
        <p>
          Brent will browse Space Express' website, as well as its competitors looking
          at the spectrum of services being offered along with the basic space travel.
          Brent will expect top class service and comfort throughout the trip should <head>
            go.  When visiting Space Express Brent would simply move onto another company
            if he has trouble finding a way to get in contact with someone about investing.
            He expects it to be possible to make the trip either by himself, or with a small
            group of other investors.  Brent expects the site to detail where the company is
            working to expand.
