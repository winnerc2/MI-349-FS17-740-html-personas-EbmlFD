          read about a reletively new venture of commerical space travel.  She decided
          to go visit the Space Express website.  Rhonda was delighted to see that there
          was more than one flight option.  She chose to book a first class trip as it offered
          higher quality food, more space, and more comfortable accomodations for the ride.
          She wondered whether there would be any extra entertainment during the flight.
