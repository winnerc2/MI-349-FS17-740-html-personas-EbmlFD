        <h1> Joe Smith </h1>
        <small> The middle class space enthusiest seeking a thrilling and unique vacation. </small>
        <p> - "It has always been my dream to go to space." </p>

        <h3> General Information </h3>
        <p> Age: 35 </p>
        <p> Occupation: Electrical Engineer </p>
        <p> Location: United States Suburbs </p>
        <p> Traits: Space-geek, risk-taker, family man </p>

        <h3> Goal </h3>
        <p>
          Experience a unique, once in a lifetime vacation in which Joe gets to
           live his dream of visiting space, while also sharing the experience with his
           family.  The trip will be memorable, and will feel safe for all involved.
        </p>

        <h3> Attitude </h3>
        <p>
          Joe feels that Space Express is a opportunity to live his dream alongside
          his family.  He doesn't expect the trip to be as luxourious as an alternative
          vacation, as he expects the thrill and uniqueness of space to make up for it.
        </p>

        <h3> Behavior </h3>
        <p>
          Joe found out about Space Express far before the space flights actually started.
          He follows the current events generally related to space travel.  He frequently
          reads articles about anything on the subject in his spare time.  When he found out
          how affordable Space Express really was, he decided it was worth looking into.
          Joe went to the Website and was happy to see flight availibility easy to be found
          on the top navbar.  With his family's biyearly vacation date coming up and an opening
          availible for that timeslot, he had made his decision.
